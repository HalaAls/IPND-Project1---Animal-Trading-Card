          Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” they jump
          up in the air and twist and spin around! A baby rabbit is called a
          kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck. A group of
          rabbits is called a herd. Rabbits are herbivores, eating a diet
          entirely of grasses and other plants.

          WRabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and
          distinctive long ears.... There are 11 genera within the family, but
          the term “true hares” refers only to species in the genus Lepus; all
          others are rabbits. Also, the American Rabbit Breeders Association
          (ARBA) recognizes 49 rabbit breeds.
